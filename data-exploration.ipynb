    "\n",
    "As a data scientist specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a thorough data exploration phase is crucial for understanding the text data, identifying patterns, and informing subsequent preprocessing and modeling steps. Here's a comprehensive pipeline with common tasks, tips, code, libraries, and useful charts, presented step-by-step in Python. The data used by this guide can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/10157504."
